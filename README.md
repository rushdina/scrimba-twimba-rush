# 🐦 Twimba (Twitter Clone)

A solo project from the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j).  
Twimba (Twitter + Scrimba) is a mini Twitter clone built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and data-driven rendering. Tweets, likes, and replies are dynamically generated from a JavaScript array, making the feed fully scalable and interactive.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamically renders tweets from a JavaScript data file.
- Displays user handle, profile picture, tweet text, like count, retweets, and replies.
- Interactive icons for like, retweet, and reply, updated in real time.
- Reply system where users can post responses to any tweet.
- Collapsible reply sections for a cleaner feed view.
- Semantic HTML structure with accessible UI.

## 🧠 What I Learned / Process
- Practiced DOM manipulation and template rendering using JavaScript.
- Implemented event delegation to handle multiple dynamic elements efficiently.
- Used data attributes to connect UI elements with tweet data.
- Reinforced understanding of array methods like .map(), .filter(), and .forEach().
- Learned to create reusable UI components and maintain state across user interactions.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- 💾 Save tweets, likes, retweets, and replies to localStorage so that data persists on reload.
- ✏️ Add tweet editing functionality for the current user.
- 🧍‍♀️ Introduce multiple user profiles or login simulation.
- 🌙 Add a dark/light mode toggle.
- 📱 Improve responsive design for mobile users.
